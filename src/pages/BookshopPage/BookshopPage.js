            TERRAIN is Melbourneâ€™s destination for ecological and
            more-than-human literature. Our carefully curated collection
            features publications that engage in critical dialogues across
            fields of ecology, technology and culture. These works highlight the
            interconnectedness between humans and the non-human world, and offer
            blueprints for how we might also design our way forward as one
            planetary ecosystem.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We hand source our books from local and international authors,
            ensure a diverse range of perspectives, and continuously update and
            expand our selections with new releases. In addition to being a
            bookshop, our space hosts intimate meetings and events. These
            include talks, book launches, performances, readings, meetups,
            prototype activations, micro-exhibits, and workshops. Through these
            local gatherings, we hope to foster meaningful connections and a
            community with a shared passion for applied ecological thinking.
